Note: While this project is capable of serving a personalized homepage, it has certain limitations in handling a large number of simultaneous visitors. If you're keen on establishing a web server designed to accommodate a broader audience, I encourage you to explore my dedicated tutorial on this subject, accessible on my website: [Creating Your Own Apache Server](https://theyoungmaker.dev/pages/tutorials/Make_a_server/).



## To Compile the code
You need to take all the files from the "code" folder and put them in a folder called "web-server" then, you should be able to compile the code.
